        <h2 class="COVID">COVID-19 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</h2>
        <h2 class="COVID">We appreciate all of you being patient with us as we begin to adapt to the new environment. Please also be patient with
us as we navigate through this crazy time.</h2>
        <p class="COVID">If you or a loved one is sick please refrain from bringing your dog to daycare or making an appointment until all is
cleared.</p>
        <p class="COVID">New Protocol: Home Pickup, drop off and walks.</p>
        <p class="COVID">If you are home when you need a service please meet the Fido’s team member at your front door with your pup leashed up
and ready to go. Fido’s team members will not enter your home if someone is home including cleaners, etc.</p>
        <p class="COVID">Here are some of the safety precautions we’re taking:</p>
        <ul class="COVID">
            <li class="COVID">We will stay 6 feet away from people at all times while on the walk, and avoid crowded areas.</li>
            <li class="COVID">We do not let other people or pups touch the dog they’re walking.</li>
            <li class="COVID">We will sanitize or wash our hands frequently between clients and wear gloves at all times. Hand sanitizer will also be
used.</li>
            <li class="COVID">We will wear a mask at all times in the client’s apartment.</li>
            <li class="COVID">We will social distance when using the elevators or indoor spaces when going to a client’s apartment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="COVID">We want to make this as easy for you as possible, and make sure everyone is safe and comfortable, especially your pooch!</p>
